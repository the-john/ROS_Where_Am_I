# Description
This is my first attempt in ROS to make a modeled robot that can self navigate and/or be navigated by the keyboard.  Next stop, let's see if I can get this code to run my JetBot through my house!

I used the ROS [AMCL](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) localization package for the self navigation, and I used the ROS [Teleop](https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard) Node for the keyboard control.

Some other VERY useful ROS websites are:

[ROS Navigation Stack Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup)

[ROS map-server](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server)

[ROS base_local_planner](http://wiki.ros.org/base_local_planner)

[ROS costmap_2d](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d)


Nobody wants to seem to have to tell you this ... but you'll need to spend a LOT of time purusing the above websites if you want to get any good at this.
